The Solo Adventurer Toolbox Story Element project is a back-end microservice for the Solo Adventurer Toolbox fullstack project, which allows the user to play Dungeons and Dragons by themselves, with the assistance of tables to randomly generate NPCs, dungeons, enemies, shops, and more. This microservice outputs wilderness features from pre-made tables.
